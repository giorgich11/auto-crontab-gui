🚀 Cron-Editor Pro

The ultimate "clicky" automation factory for Linux. Created by giorgich11 (the legend behind Auto-Bash-to-Bin).
🛠 What is this?

Cron-Editor Pro is a GUI-based manager for your Linux automation. Instead of wrestling with crontab -e and cryptic star-symbols, you get a clean dashboard to:

    Write Code: A built-in editor to script directly in the app.

    Schedule: Easy fields for setting your timing.

    Manage: View, Edit, or Delete your scheduled tasks with one click.

    Auto-Storage: All scripts are saved and kept executable in ~/.cron-factory/.

📦 Setup & Installation
1. Grab the dependency

This tool uses YAD for the heavy-duty GUI lifting.
Bash

sudo apt update && sudo apt install yad -y

2. Get the Script

Clone the repo or download the gui.bin file
3. Make it Executable (The "chmod" Step)

Linux won't run a script unless you give it the "Go" signal. Open your terminal in the folder and run:
Bash

chmod +x gui.sh

    What does this do? chmod changes permissions. +x means "eXecutable." Now it's a real program, not just a text file.

🚀 How to Run

You can fire it up from the terminal:
Bash
./gui.sh

./cron-editor-pro.sh
